# workingWithReactRouter

This repo is my playground for learning React Router v6, Here, I experimented with:

- Setting up routes and paths for different pages
- Handling errors and showing fallback pages
- Creating layouts that wrap around multiple routes
- Nesting routes for better organization
- Fetching and submitting data using **loaders** and **actions**
- Using `fetcher` to get data without leaving the page
- Deferring data loading so pages can show something while the data is still loading
